## Page 1

1.  **Increase in Emission**
    -   Late 1970s: Arab oil crisis\
    -   Slow gain in GDP\
    -   GDP from fuel
2.  **Oil and CO₂ Increased**
    -   Increase in coal, then China
3.  **Correlation between Emissions / Prosperity**
    -   Because of correlation between energy & prosperity
4.  **Consequence of Emission**
    -   CO₂ levels increased in atmosphere\
    -   In 1900 → 100 Gt CO₂ in atmosphere\
    -   200 Gt CO₂ emission
5.  **Business as usual**, we use Carbon as we used
    -   Now and demand increase in developing population
6.  **Reduce CO₂ emission and terminate term**
    -   But that's not enough --- we need **"re-emission cut"** to get
        to 2°C\
    -   Last IPCC report says that 2°C is not good --- we need to look
        for **1.5°C**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 2

-   What will Earth look like to change the climate beyond 2°C?\
    It will not be the life we know and the civilization we have.\
    You might flee your country and invade another country --- yet the
    borders are very small.

-   This is not the geological million-year need that you get from **ice
    cores**.

-   **Last time CO₂ = 280 ppm**

    -   Every 100,000 years → Ice age and interglacial ages repeatedly.

-   This is not what happened in the past ---\
    This is about 100 ppm and how fast that occurred --- within **a
    lifetime**.

-   Now we care about how much CO₂ in the atmosphere and should be
    worried when humans first came to Earth:

    -   First recorded use of fire by hominids about **400,000 years
        ago**, in fossil sites in Africa.\
    -   **Homo sapiens** evolved from early hominids between **200k to
        300k years ago**.\
    -   Life started shifting outdoors during a **severe ice age 70,000
        years ago**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 3

-   **Human oldest Homo sapiens fossils** were found in Morocco --- 315k
    years ago, East Africa, out of Africa → continued between 70k--100k
    years ago.

-   Humans clustering by tools, making but changing diet → good at food
    making.

-   Humans learned to keep warm by burning carbon.

-   We still learn to keep warm by burning carbon --- we're "burning
    carbon" as our solution to everything.

-   Humans learned now that this is an inherited idea.

-   Humans have evolved in cold conditions --- so, going in such warm
    conditions is **unparalleled**.

-   **Agriculture started 10,000 years ago**, setting the start of
    modern human civilization.

    → **Mesopotamia: Euphrates & Tigris rivers**

    → Mountain / glaciated record

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 4

-   With CO₂, we know that we're antagonizing (climate).
    -   "We mind it. This is not going to hurt anybody."
-   **Senator from PA** for many years --- the candidate of 2016 did not
    care then,
    -   The risk will go back.
-   **How can such a small contribution make any difference?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 5

-   **Troposphere** is the lowest dense part of the atmosphere.\
-   How trace gases can worsen climate days?

### The Chemical Composition of the Troposphere:

-   N₂ = 78%\
-   O₂ = 21%\
-   Argon (Ar) = 1% → Noble gas, no chemistry

### Atmospheric water vapor:

-   Clear days / cloudy days → heterogeneous\
-   Water vapor (H₂O) = \<1%

You don't have to write this down because next year, you will change the
numbers.

### Near, medium, important trace hydrogen gases:

-   Red contributions by anthropogenic activities:
    -   **CO₂**\
    -   **CH₄ (Methane)**\
    -   **N₂O (Nitrous oxide)**\
    -   **O₃ (Ozone)**

> "These gases --- when abundant --- are the **greenhouse gases**
> (GHGs)."

> "If we come to a hydrogen economy, then hydrogen will leak --- and
> this will be changing."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 6

### What makes trace gases so special?

-   "Trace gases" means gases that exist in **a small amount** in the
    atmosphere.\
-   **N₂ + O₂ + Ar = 99.934%** of the atmosphere.

### Radiatively active gases in the troposphere:

-   What makes gases couple to radiation?

→ If all gases coupled to radiation, the atmosphere would be dark.\
You cannot see the blue light because it doesn't get through.

→ The atmosphere is transparent because gases allow **visible light** to
come in to the atmosphere.

→ It's hard for **infrared light** to get out of the atmosphere ---
visible and invisible light behave differently.

#### \[Diagram on page 6\]

A hand-drawn **spectrum** showing: - **Radio waves** on the left\
- **Visible spectrum** in the center (with labeled "blue" and "yellow")\
- **Infrared and ultraviolet** on either side

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 7

-   Infrared light finds it hard to get out of the atmosphere because
    there are **trace gases** that absorb **infrared radiation**.

### Why do some gases absorb infrared radiation?

Because of their **molecular structure**.

### The Major Molecules

**N ≡ N**\
- Translation\
- Vibration\
- Rotation\
- Spin around its axis

**O = O**\
- Same behaviors as N₂

→ The more motion the hotter it is:\
- More rotation\
- More translation\
- More vibration

**N₂**: Two equal atoms (homonuclear diatomic molecule).\
→ Electrons are shared equally by both atoms → **no charge separation**
(chemical bonding).

**H₂O**: H and O are two different elements → sharing electrons between
them.\
→ Much more **electronegativity** difference → oxygen attracts the
shared electrons strongly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 8

**Oxygen (O₂):** - 2nd and 3rd most electronegative element on the
periodic table.\
- H₂ is down in the middle.\
→ O wants more electrons --- it's like "jealous."\
→ We share an electron → "share a blanket --- it's all on your side."

**H₂O** forms a **polar covalent bond** (unequal sharing).\
- Partial (+) charge on hydrogen\
- Partial (--) charge on oxygen

**Sodium chloride (NaCl)** → **ionic bond**\
- Na⁺ gives electron to Cl⁻ → they separate and dissolve in water.\
- In solid, they are bonded; in liquid, fall apart.

**Electrodynamics**:\
- Two charged particles when close and vibrating → they exert a force.\
- Their electric fields interact → prevent them from losing energy
easily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 9

**If you are in a quantum state**, minimize state energy → gain or lose
energy by **emission or absorption of radiation**.

### Molecular Interactions

-   **N₂** and **O₂**: Non-polar, symmetric → no electromagnetic
    interaction.

-   **You can't vibrate without possessing dipole moment** → gases are
    in specific **quantum states** (energy levels).\
    → You can't go between energy levels without gaining or losing
    energy (absorption/emission).

### Electromagnetic Interaction

-   You can change between energy states by absorbing or emitting
    photons.\
-   **Photon** = smallest piece of light.\
-   Spin = 1 (photon's intrinsic angular momentum).\
-   Cannot absorb more than one photon per transition.

→ **Thermodynamically interacting molecules** can change temperature by
absorbing or emitting photons --- heating up or cooling down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 10

-   The same rule applies to carbon dioxide and other electromagnetic
    molecules.\
-   **CO₂** (and others) are vibrating and bending.

**Charged atom of a molecule:** - The atom moves back and forth, causing
**radiative interaction**.\
- Because it's in a quantum state, it vibrates at a constant frequency.\
- A photon gets absorbed → adds energy → it vibrates faster.\
- The molecule becomes warmer.\
- It emits a photon → cools off again.

> "This only happens when you have two atoms with electronegativity
> within a covalent bond."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 11

### Molecular Dipole Moments

-   **N₂** → No electric dipole moment
    -   Still rotating and translating\
    -   No electron dipole separation\
    -   No charge separation
-   **CO₂** → Charge separates → *bipolar greenhouse gas*

### Vibrational Energy Levels

-   Molecules interact with **infrared (IR) radiation** through
    **vibrational energy levels**.\

-   They cannot react with visible or bright photons --- those are too
    energetic and don't match vibrational frequencies.

-   Molecules **absorb IR radiation** only when their vibration
    frequency corresponds to that of the photon's energy.

-   **CO₂ = radiative reaction molecule**\

-   **CH₄ = multiple modes of vibration**\

-   **N₂O = two different atoms, vibrationally asymmetric**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 12

### Ozone (O₃)

-   O₃ has three atoms of oxygen but **an odd structure** because of its
    **dual bonding nature** (two and a half bonds).\
-   Two strong O=O bonds but when a third oxygen atom attaches → no
    neutrality.

**What did Richard Sandor miss?**\
→ *Trace gases warm the entire dog (the planet)*

-   **N₂** does not mean temperature, it does not heat up or cool down
    the land.\
-   **Simple molecules** do not react with radiation --- they let it
    pass through.\
-   But **complex molecules** with **dipole moments** interact with
    radiation --- absorbing and re-emitting energy.

### Summary Notes

-   "Bright has small particle called photon."\
-   Heat photon → cool IR radiation.\
-   Heat → particle emits photon.\
-   GHG = Greenhouse gas → traps heat.\
-   H₂O, CH₄, CO₂ → all trap heat (greenhouse gases).\
-   "HC in climate change = greenhouse gas influence."\
-   Causes changes in **global warming** and **climate**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 13

-   **Water rotating** knocks other molecules; they start to spin.
    -   This leads to **vibrational transitions** --- keeps happening
        until temperature rises.\
    -   Once hot enough, they stop doing this → stop absorbing.
-   The **whole show in the atmosphere is controlled by trace gases**.
    -   We are mixing with those gases --- they are the ones running the
        show.
-   **Infrared-absorbing gases** all have **polar molecules**, i.e. they
    have **charge differences** that can be excited by photons of
    **infrared (IR)** and **thermal energy**.

➡️ *Key physical reason of how greenhouse gas (GHG) occurs.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 14

### Infrared Radiation

-   A place where we originated from --- what does this have to do with
    the atmosphere we live in?

-   **IR radiation sensed by us as heat** (e.g., heat coming out of an
    oven).

    -   The sensation of heat is **electromagnetic radiation**.

### Main Greenhouse Gases

-   **Water vapor (H₂O)** --- main GHG.
    -   But water is **non-condensable** gas in Earth's conditions → it
        doesn't "run" the show; it follows temperature.\
    -   It cools → condenses → liquid → freezes → ice condensate.
-   **CO₂, CH₄, N₂O** --- these do **not condense** under Earth's
    temperature and pressure conditions.
    -   They stay gaseous --- thus **drive the greenhouse effect**.\
    -   "Once the atmosphere can't freeze CO₂, CH₄, N₂O --- these
        dominate."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 15

### Water Vapor and Climate Regulation

-   **H₂O** most abundant, but does not "do anything" on its own.
    -   Water vapor forms **feedback loops**: raises background
        temperature → warms up → more water vapor.\
    -   H₂O is **controlled by temperature**.
-   **CO₂ is the thermostat** of our planet.

> "It's like you've got a visitor and they touch the thermostat and your
> HVAC unit."

→ People who know what's going on adjust it correctly; people who don't
know make things unstable.

### Basic Concept of GHG

-   Someone who doesn't understand what's going on is like someone
    **tampering with the thermostat** --- disrupting Earth's climate
    balance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 16

### The Greenhouse Effect in Energy Balance

-   The **Sun emits shortwave radiation** (visible and ultraviolet).
    -   It passes through the atmosphere and reaches Earth's surface.\
    -   The Earth absorbs energy → warms up.
-   The **Earth emits longwave (infrared) radiation** back into space.
    -   But part of that IR is **absorbed and re-emitted** by greenhouse
        gases (GHGs).\
    -   This **traps heat** within the atmosphere --- the **greenhouse
        effect**.

### Key Greenhouse Gases:

  Gas              Symbol   Approximate Concentration (ppm)   Role
  ---------------- -------- --------------------------------- ------------------------
  Carbon dioxide   CO₂      \~420                             Main anthropogenic GHG
  Methane          CH₄      \~2                               Strong short-term GHG
  Nitrous oxide    N₂O      \~0.3                             Agricultural GHG
  Ozone            O₃       variable                          Absorbs UV + IR
  Water vapor      H₂O      variable                          Feedback gas

### Important Note:

-   The atmosphere is *not a perfect blanket* --- it **lets some
    infrared radiation escape** through the **atmospheric window**
    (8--13 µm wavelength range).\
-   This "window" is critical; without it, Earth would be **\~30°C
    warmer**.

> "The greenhouse effect is natural --- but human activity is
> intensifying it."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 17

### Anthropogenic Greenhouse Effect

-   **Human activities** add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere:
    -   Burning fossil fuels → CO₂\
    -   Agriculture → CH₄, N₂O\
    -   Deforestation → less CO₂ uptake

→ These gases **trap more heat** and **change the energy balance** of
the planet.

### Energy Budget (simplified diagram)

*(Hand-drawn sketch on this page)*\
- Solar radiation in = 100 units\
- Reflected by clouds, surface, aerosols ≈ 30 units\
- Absorbed by surface and atmosphere ≈ 70 units\
- Emitted as longwave radiation (infrared)\
- Some escapes to space; some is trapped by greenhouse gases and
re-emitted toward Earth

### Final Notes / Summary

-   Without GHGs, average Earth temperature ≈ **--18°C**\
-   With natural GHGs, ≈ **+15°C** (suitable for life)\
-   With enhanced GHGs, warming continues → **climate change**

**Key Takeaways:** 1. Greenhouse gases absorb and emit infrared
radiation.\
2. Human emissions intensify the natural greenhouse effect.\
3. CO₂ acts as the *control knob* of Earth's temperature.\
4. Stabilizing climate requires *reducing GHG concentrations*.\
5. "We are the thermostat --- whether we know it or not."
